# To-Do List API

**To-Do List API** is a pet project designed to practice skills in software development, focusing on RESTful principles. This API allows managing tasks (To-Do) with support for tags, users, and categories. The project is built using **ASP.NET Core 8** with **Entity Framework Core** for database interaction and **PostgreSQL** as the database. **Fluent Validation** is used for data validation, and **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** are employed to streamline communication between the client and server. Additionally, **Serilog** is implemented for logging, including support for **Seq** and **Elasticsearch** for storing and analyzing logs.

The project now also utilizes **xUnit** for unit testing, **Moq** for mocking dependencies, **FluentAssertions** for more readable assertions in tests, and **AutoFixture** for automated test data generation. Docker is used to run the API in a container alongside PostgreSQL, providing an efficient development and deployment environment. The image for the API is available on Docker Hub as `cladkoewka/to-do-api-cladkoewka:latest`.

The API and database are deployed using **Render**, while the frontend is hosted on **GitHub Pages**. The project demonstrates key principles of **Clean Architecture**, ensuring separation of concerns, flexibility, and scalability, making it a great example for honing development skills and applying best practices in API design.

You can access the frontend at: [To-Do List Frontend](https://github.com/Cladkoewka/ToDoListFrontend).

- **POST /api/tasks** — Creates a new task.
- **PUT /api/tasks/{id}** — Updates an existing task.
- **DELETE /api/tasks/{id}** — Deletes a task by its ID.

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Deployment Using Docker

1. **Pull the API Image from Docker Hub**

   Run the following command to download the API image:

   ```bash
   docker pull cladkoewka/to-do-api-cladkoewka:latest
   ```

2. **Create the `docker-compose.yml`**

   You can copy the `docker-compose.yml` file from the current repository to your local machine. Make sure to adjust any necessary configuration settings in the file.

3. **Start the Containers**

   In the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` is located, run the following command to start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will start the containers for the API and PostgreSQL.

4. **Check the API**

   Once the containers are running, the API will be accessible at:

   ```
   http://localhost:8080/api
   ```

   You can test the API endpoints using tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).
